"@type": "Answer",

"name": "How is gold Chandbali different from normal earrings?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "
Gold Chandbalis come specifically in a crescent moon shape while normal earrings can be a stud, hoop, drop, or dangle. Normal earrings can be of any shape and design- from peacocks to geometric styles. However, Chandbalis are off only a crescent moon shape."
