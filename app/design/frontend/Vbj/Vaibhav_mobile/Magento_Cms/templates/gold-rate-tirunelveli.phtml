                composition. 24K gold is pure, containing 99.9% gold, while 22K gold contains 91.7% gold and the
                remaining 8.3% consists of other metals like copper or silver. Consequently, 24K gold is more expensive
                but less durable, making it ideal for intricate jewelry. In contrast, 22K gold is known for its
